## [Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres](https://github.com/DanielBBZ/UdacityDataEngineering/tree/main/project1) 
In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. A startup wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they are collecting data in json format and the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.


## [Project 2: NoSQL Databases - Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/DanielBBZ/UdacityDataEngineering/tree/main/project2).
Designed a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra based on the original schema outlined in project one. Skills include:
* Created a nosql database using Apache Cassandra
* Developed denormalized tables optimized for a specific set queries and business needs

Proficiencies used: Python, Apache Cassandra, Denormalization
